## About me
I am a very purposeful and inquisitive person, I like to study and learn new things. I am interested in Front-end development in JS. I don't have any work experience yet, I'm taking courses to become a Junior developer. I easily get used to a new place, and also like to work in a team. My friends and acquaintances say that I am responsible and you can rely on me. I think the opinion of others about me coincides with reality.
